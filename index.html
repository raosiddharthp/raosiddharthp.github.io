        <h1>Building Tomorrow's Enterprise AI</h1>

        <p class="project-description">
            I design and deliver production-grade Generative AI solutions that solve real enterprise challenges — from sustainability and financial crime detection to revenue recognition and contract intelligence.
        </p>

        <p class="project-description">
            As a TOGAF-certified Enterprise Architect, Google Cloud-certified Professional Cloud Architect and Machine Learning Engineer, and SAFe-certified SPC, I approach every solution with end-to-end ownership: from strategic alignment and stakeholder visioning to secure, scalable GCP implementation, agentic AI orchestration, and governed handover to operations.
        </p>

        <p class="project-description">
            This portfolio documents nine complete lifecycle case studies. Each project demonstrates deep integration of Google Cloud services (Vertex AI, Document AI, BigQuery ML, Agent Builder) alongside leading open-source frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, Llama, Mistral) — proving that enterprise AI thrives on the best of both worlds.
        </p>

        <p class="project-description">
            These are not prototypes. They are enterprise-ready patterns: cost-optimized (often free-tier viable), compliant (GDPR, SOC2, IFRS 15), measurable (30–90% efficiency gains), and governed through SAFe ARTs and agile release trains.
        </p>

        <p class="project-description">
            Explore the projects below to see how strategic architecture, modern cloud engineering, and agentic AI combine to deliver lasting business impact.
