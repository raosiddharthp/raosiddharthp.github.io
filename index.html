        <p>This site documents my journey building Generative AI apps for the enterprise.</p>
        <p>For each app, I have aimed to document the entire lifecycle of development, starting from Customer interviews and ending with handover to support.</p>
        <p>As a TOGAF Certified Enterprise Architect, I have added as much nuance and detail as possible to the various phases of architecting solutions for enterprise grade solutions as the ones demonstrated in this portfolio.</p>
        <p>While the Apps themselves are a collections of several tools and technologies, as a Google Certified Cloud Architect, Machine Learning Engineer, and a Gen AI Leader, I have attempted to use every Google Cloud offering through the suite of applications.</p>
        <p>My skills however are not just limited to Google Suite of products and you will find each project interspersed with several open source agents, APIs, and services.</p>
        <p>Besides the design and development of Apps, I'm also a SAFe certified SPC and this helps me get insights into governance of such projects in the real world. In each project, I have also added details of ARTs and other Agile methodologies that help with release and delivery.</p>
        <p>Each Project has its own page with sections relevant to the full lifecycle journey.</p>
